MeshSimplification done by Dan Ning Yang 260743330
All meshes except the 1st(tetrahedron) and last one(monkey) works with mesh simplification
Press shift+c to set the mesh to a tetrahedron, then scroll the LOD scroll bar to see the simplifications
The monkey mesh does not work because I didn't do the bonus.
